# Accommodations

A block of rooms is available at the [Ambassador Inn & Suites](http://www.goambassadorinn.com/) from Friday, June 24th until Sunday, June 26th. The rate associated with the Kennedy/Muller wedding is $123.43 per room per night (including taxes and fees), but make sure you ask for the Kennedy/Muller wedding rate!

**Make sure you book by June 3rd to ensure that you get a room.** If you book after the 3rd, you will still be able to get the discounted rate, but the hotel will release the unreserved rooms so you run the risk of not getting a room at all.

The inn is a 5-minute walk away from the church.
